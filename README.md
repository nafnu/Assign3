## Project Summary
A little elephant named Dumpo had some magical balloons that took him on an interdimensional journey. In this reality, he wants to get the balloons that transported him to that place, to continue travelling to other places... In this game, it was about presenting the theme of duality with the gravity that affects the player, it was planned to make this game for two players. With the keyboard, the duality is represented by a player with the movement of the elephant and another player controlling gravity.

* Controls of player with the arrow.
* Gravity with the space.
